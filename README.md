# LuaNN
A Lua / LuaJIT neural network library

I originally built this 10 years ago, then lost that github account - https://github.com/wixico/luann
I've updated this and added activation functions, better comments, and am separating serialization from the core neural network functionality.

The demonstration script sets things up for a basic XOR network, uses swish to demonstrate multiparameter activation functions.

This library is intentionally pedantic so it can be riffed on easily.
